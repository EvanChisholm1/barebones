# Barebones llm

Project to do inference on a large language model in just raw C and eventually CUDA.

## Roadmap

-   [x] Character level language model in torch, pretty similar to makemore
-   [ ] write all weights to file
-   [ ] read weights from file in C + store in prefered data structure
-   [ ] write forward pass in C
-   [ ] transformer model in torch
-   [ ] transformer forward pass in C
-   [ ] CUDA forward pass
